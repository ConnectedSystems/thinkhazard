01/27/2015 IT meeting minutes

These meeting minutes will serve as the base for a document on the high-level
specifications. The document should also include the defintion of terms like
"recommendations", "data submission process", etc.

- Who are the developers? Involvement?

  Vivien and Ariel will do code reviews
  Vivien and Ariel may work on specific things (GeoNode-related stuff for example)
  Talk about architecture

- Technology decisions

  Vivien and Ariel will participate to decisions

- Project managment tool

  We need to have a tool
  We need a central place to store documents
  To be discussed

- Data

  The size is not known right now
  There are global and local layers
  One global layer per risk type
  There is a GIS person at GFDRR responsible for the data

- Architecture / Infrastructure

  GeoNode exposes the layer metadata through CSW (PyCSW)
  GeoServer is used to serve the data
  The vector data is stored in PostGIS tables
  The raster data is stored as TIFF files

- Data Formats

  The format of the input data needs to be defined

  The input data for a layer:
  - SQL or TIFF file for the data
  - SQL file for the metadata

  The format (column names, column types, units) needs to be defined. The tool
  (Data Submission Process) will check the conformity of the data.

  The styles (SLD) are defined on the HST software side.

  The recommandation documents are added by the HST administrator.

- HST Administration Interface

  An admin interface is needed for the admin the add recommandations and
  set/change the thresholds.

- POC work

  Work with two hazard types. Define the input format for these two hazard
  types.

  Work with both local and global data (two different scales).

  The POC work should be based on one or two use-cases. The POC should cover
  the whole system:

  - [BO] Submit data
  - [BO] Categorize the data (depends the thresholds)
  - [FO] Selection of a location (possibly pre-defined)
  - [FO] Show the answer to the location (with a static map)

  Question: What selection modes do we want? Use a map? Multi-selection?

  What needs to be defined for the POC:

  - Input data (format, resolution, …)
  - Simple catagorization precesses
  - Macroscopic use-case definition (data selection)
  - Vocabulary definition (categorization, …)

- Location selection

  Use-cases: "Horn of Africa", "South of France", "East Paris" => No. This
  is too complex.

  But it should be possible to select multiple areas at the same admin level.
  The UI should make this possible.

  The Location data is provided by GFDRR.

- Do we want a map for the location selection?

  Yes, probably.

  See <http://bnpe.eaufrance.fr/acces-donnees> for example.

- Do we need to have a map in the response page?

  In GeoRisques per-hazard type static maps are displayed. This is probably
  sufficient. The map needs a legend and a scale.

- Background layer

  OpenStreetMap-based background layer. Humanitarian layer for example.

- Operating System

  Using Debian is ok.

- Browser compatibility
  
  Internet Explorer 9

- Map projection

  What projection do we use?
  The easy one is to use Web Mercator.

- Tools/librairies

  Use whatever Camptocamp feel confortable with.
  MapServer, Pyramid, OpenLayers, AngularJS
